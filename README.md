# pointillist portraits

I saw some cool [dot art](https://www.lumas.com/pictures/richard_brandao/bowie/) the other day. I wanted my own, so I decided to write up this script. I sample from a gaussian where the mean is the average pixel value of the subrectangle being drawn with a parameterized variance. This makes the 'art' look more natural and is this script's UVP. Results below!
